# Text Highlighter Prototype
## Intro
This test that I did required me to create a miniature prototype with a highlighting function that allows the user to:
- Type in / Paste in formatted text
- Allow users to make multiple, overlapping selections
- Show all selections separately on the page
## Getting Started
1. Install Node on your system properly https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. In Terminal/Command Prompt/Power Shell, go to the root directory of this project
3. Run `npm install` in Terminal/Command Prompt/Power Shell - this will install all the needed prerequisites
4. Run `npm start`
5. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
## Features I Would Add Next Time
- The editor I used seems to not support text highlighting in any easy way. Next time I would try out a new library. Otherwise I would look into alternative ways to implement text highlighting thats not a hack approach.
